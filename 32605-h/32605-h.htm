 />THE CAT</h2>


<p><ins class="TN" title="invisible in original; inferred">The</ins> cat is a very useful do<ins class="TN" title="original only shows 'do-'; remainder inferred">mestic</ins>
animal.  She destroys
<ins class="TN" title="all but 's' invisible in original; inferred, having regard to amount of blank space">the rat</ins>s and mice, which otherwise
would do much injury.
God has formed her to live
among men. How soft her fur
is! How quietly she lies and
purs when she is treated kindly!
How patiently she will sit, for
many hours together, and watch
for her prey! It would be well
if little boys and girls would sit
as still while they are learning
their lessons.</p>

  alt="dog" title="" /><br
 />THE DOG.</h2>


<p>The Dog takes care of his
master&#8217;s property; he follows
him about, and will not let any
body hurt him. Should a stranger
come, he barks, to let his
master know it. He is easily
taught a great many useful
things.<!-- period invisible in original --> A shepherd&#8217;s dog will
not let the sheep go astray. It
would be well if little boys and
girls were always as faithful to
their parents as the dog is to his
master.</p>

  alt="cow" title="" /><br
 />THE COW.</h2>


<p>The cow is a very valuable
animal, and useful in many
ways. I dare say you like to
have her milk for breakfast,
and to eat sometimes a piece of
beef at dinner. The skin is
tanned and made into shoes;
the horns are made into many
useful articles; the bones make
combs, and many other things,
nearly as well as ivory; the hair
is used in making mortar, with
which our houses are plastered
and made warm. How wonderfully
has God provided for
the convenience of man.</p>




<h2><a name="png.007" id="png.007" href="#png.007"><span class="ns">[</span><span

 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-007.png" width="338" height="275"
  alt="fox" title="" /><br
 />THE FOX.</h2>


<p>The Fox is a cunning and
mischievous animal. He is
troublesome to the farmer, frequently
killing his geese and
chickens. People are obliged
to go, in great numbers, sometimes,
to hunt them out of their
holes and hiding places.&mdash;Do
you remember what our Saviour
said of himself? &ldquo;The foxes
have holes, and the birds of the
air have nests, but the Son of
man hath not where to lay his
head.&ldquo;</p>

  alt="goat" title="" /><br
 />THE GOAT.</h2>


<p>The Goat is a useful animal
when tamed, and it is very cruel
for little boys to teaze them.
Their milk is very wholesome,
though not as good as that of
the cow. &ldquo;The high hills are a
refuge for the wild goats.&rdquo;
When Saul persecuted David,
he was forced to hide among
the rocks where the goats were
found. Read 1 Samuel, xxiv.&nbsp;2.<!-- final period invisible in original --></p>




<h2><a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="ns">[</span><span

 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-009.png" width="279" height="218"
  alt="horse" title="" /><br
 />THE HORSE.</h2>


<p>The horse is a noble and useful
animal. He is very strong and
active. The Psalmist says,
&ldquo;Some trust in chariots, and
some in horses; but we will remember
the name of our God.&rdquo;
This is to teach us not to trust
in any thing in this world, however
good or great it may be,
but to look to God alone for
strength and protection.</p>




<h2><a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-010.png" width="329" height="257"
  alt="ass" title="" /><br
 />THE ASS</h2>


<p>In eastern countries, the Ass
is a much larger and stronger
animal than it is here. It is not
easily tamed, but it is very useful,
and one of the most patient
of beasts when it is tamed. Job
says, &ldquo;Vain man would be wise,
though man be born like a wild
ass&#8217;s colt.&rdquo; Job, xi.&nbsp;24. For
we are all naturally inclined to
do what is evil and wrong, unless
our hearts are subdued by
the power of divine grace.</p>




<h2><a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-011.png" width="232" height="139"
  alt="lamb" title="" /><br
 />THE LAMB.</h2>


<p>In the Bible, Christ is compared
to a lamb, because lambs
were sacrificed as an offering for
sin. John the Baptist pointed
out Christ to his disciples, and
said, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of
God, that taketh away the sin
of the world.&rdquo;&mdash;Think upon
what Christ suffered for you,
and pray that you may love
him, and that he would cause
you to hate sin, and to do his
will.</p>




<h2><a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-012.png" width="248" height="154"
  alt="sheep" title="" /><br
 />THE SHEEP.</h2>


<p>When Sheep wander from
their fold, they will not find
their way back again at night,
unless they are driven home.
Dogs, and many other animals,
can find their way home, but
sheep cannot find their way to
their fold. &ldquo;All we, like sheep
have gone astray.&rdquo; Christ is
the good Shepherd; he will
take care of those who love
him; for he laid down his life
for his sheep.</p>




<h2><a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-013.png" width="350" height="290"
  alt="lion" title="" /><br
 />THE LION.</h2>


<p>The Lion is one of the strongest
and fiercest of wild beasts.
The Bible says, &ldquo;The righteous
are bold as a lion.&rdquo; But wicked
men are strong also: the Psalmist
prayed that God would
&ldquo;save him from the lion&#8217;s
mouth.&rdquo; You recollect about
Daniel in the lions&#8217; den;&mdash;God
sent an angel and shut the lions&#8217;
mouths.</p>




<h2><a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-014.png" width="478" height="425"
  alt="tiger" title="" /><br
 />THE TIGER.</h2>


<p>The Tiger is a native of Africa.
He is a very fierce beast.
Angry persons are often compared
to the tiger; and certainly
they resemble furious wild
beasts. Perhaps they do not
intend to do harm, but they often
do a great deal of mischief;
therefore &ldquo;leave off contention
before it be meddled with.&rdquo;</p>




<h2><a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-015.png" width="353" height="293"
  alt="serpent" title="" /><br
 />THE SERPENT</h2>


<p>&ldquo;O what an ugly Serpent!&rdquo;
says some little boy or girl who
is reading this book. Do you
remember who it was that took
the form of a serpent, and tempted
our first parents to sin against
God? Read the account of it
in the third chapter of the book
of Genesis; and remember,
when you sin against God, you
resemble the &ldquo;old serpent, the
Devil.&rdquo;</p>




<h2><a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="ns">[</span><span

 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-016.png" width="429" height="366"
  alt="reindeer" title="" /><br
 />THE REINDEER.</h2>


<p>The Reindeer is an inhabitant
of cold countries. The Laplanders
find them very serviceable;
they draw their sledges
over the snow and ice for them,
and their skins make a warm
covering from the cold. How
wonderful are the works of God!<!-- exclamation mark partially invisible in original -->
There is nothing made in vain.<!-- period invisible in original --></p>

 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-017.png" width="372" height="357"
  alt="cross victorious" title="" /></h2>


<p>The prophet Isaiah tells us,
that &ldquo;the wolf shall dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard shall
lie down with the kid, and the
calf, and the young lion, and the
fatling together, and a little
child shall lead them.&rdquo; Isaiah
xi. These words foretell that
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>blessed time when Satan shall
be chained for a thousand years,
and Christ shall reign throughout
the earth. That period is
called the Millenium.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
